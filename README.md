## Description

Volo is an application that is designed to make searching for and finding, as well as out reach to interested parties more pleasurable
and personable. It allopws for a user to sign up as either a volunteer or a recruiter for an organization. Depending on what
they sign up as, the user will either be presented with a specific user experience for a volunteer searching for volunteer 
opportunities or an experience for an organization's recruiter. Volo is distinct in that it prompts in-app messaging between 
a volunteer and recruiter for a volunteer organization. Once a volunteer has searched for an opportunity and showed their interest 
in the opportunity, the recruiter who made the posting for the opportunity will be notified and a chat can be initiated by either side.
